This is normal for wholesale suppliers!

  - Colors show as solid color blocks
  - Works for basic color identification
  - No mockup images needed
  - Site is functional NOW

Option B: Upload your own mockups (RECOMMENDED FOR PROFESSIONAL LOOK)
  - Use Printful.com (free mockup generator)
  - Generate mockups for your top 10 products
  - Upload via Admin > Products > Edit
  - Takes 1-2 hours total
  - Much more professional!

Option C: Buy mockup packs
  - Search "Bella Canvas mockup bundle" on Etsy
  - Usually $20-50 for complete pack
  - Includes all colors
  - Ready to use

Right now your site is 100% FUNCTIONAL - mockup images just make it look 
even more professional!
