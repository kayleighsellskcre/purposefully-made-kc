================================================================================
          COLOR MOCKUPS & INVENTORY SYSTEM IS NOW LIVE!
================================================================================


WHAT'S NEW:
===========================================================================

Your platform now fetches and displays:

1. MOCKUP IMAGES FOR EVERY COLOR
   - Front view for each color
   - Back view for each color
   - Side view (if available)

2. LIVE INVENTORY QUANTITIES
   - Real-time stock levels for each size
   - Shows "S (45 in stock)", "M (120 in stock)", etc.
   - Updates every time you sync

3. COLOR-SPECIFIC DISPLAY
   - Click a color, see THAT color's mockup
   - Each color has its own front/back images
   - No more generic mockups!


HOW IT WORKS:
===========================================================================

When you sync from S&S Activewear, the system now:

STEP 1: Gets basic product info (name, description, price)

STEP 2: Fetches ALL SKUs for that product
  Example: 3001-Black-S, 3001-Black-M, 3001-White-S, etc.

STEP 3: Groups by color and extracts:
  - Front mockup image URL for that color
  - Back mockup image URL for that color
  - Side image (if available)

STEP 4: Gets inventory for each size in that color
  Example for Black:
    S: 45 units
    M: 120 units
    L: 89 units
    XL: 67 units
    2XL: 23 units

STEP 5: Saves everything to database in "product_color_variant" table


DATABASE STRUCTURE:
===========================================================================

NEW TABLE: product_color_variant

Columns:
  - id (primary key)
  - product_id (links to product)
  - color_name (e.g., "Black", "White", "Navy")
  - color_hex (optional hex code)
  - front_image_url (S&S mockup URL for front)
  - back_image_url (S&S mockup URL for back)
  - side_image_url (S&S mockup URL for side)
  - size_inventory (JSON: {"S": 45, "M": 120, "L": 89, ...})
  - ss_color_id (S&S internal color ID)
  - last_synced (timestamp)
