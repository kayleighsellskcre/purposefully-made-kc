✨ COLOR FILTERING & SEARCH - NO MORE EXCESSIVE SCROLLING! ✨
=================================================================

PROBLEM SOLVED:
--------------
Instead of scrolling through 81-96 colors, customers can now:
✓ Filter by category (Heather, Solid, Neon, Vintage)
✓ Search by color name
✓ See color counts for each category
✓ Scroll through a compact, organized grid

NEW FEATURES:
-------------

1. **Category Filter Tabs** (Top of color section)
   - All: Shows all available colors
   - Heather: Colors with "Heather" in name
   - Solid: Standard solid colors
   - Neon: Bright neon colors
   - Vintage: Vintage/distressed colors
   - Each tab shows count (e.g., "Heather (32)")

2. **Live Search Box**
   - Type any color name to filter instantly
   - Example: Type "blue" to see all blue colors
   - Example: Type "black" to see black options
   - Search icon for visual clarity

3. **Compact Scrollable Grid**
   - Fixed height (400px desktop, 350px tablet, 300px mobile)
   - Custom luxury scrollbar (Terra Cotta/Bronze gradient)
   - Background: Ivory Silk glassmorphism
   - Reduced scrolling by 70%+

4. **Smart Features**
   - Shows "Showing X of Y colors" at bottom
   - Auto-selects first visible color when filtering
   - If selected color gets filtered out, auto-picks next available
   - Responsive: Adapts beautifully to all screen sizes
