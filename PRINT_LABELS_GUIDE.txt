(3 columns × 10 rows). Labels auto-fill in order—when a sheet is full, a new 
sheet starts.

LABEL FORMATS
-------------
• SHIPPING ORDERS: Name + full address (street, city, state, zip)
• PICKUP ORDERS: Name, phone, email

Each label includes the order number (e.g., KB20260210ABC1) for production reference.

LABEL SHEET LAYOUT
------------------
• 3 columns × 10 rows = 30 labels per sheet
• Matches Avery 5160 / similar 3×10 address label sheets
• Labels fill left-to-right, top-to-bottom
• Empty slots on the last sheet show as dashed boxes (don't print on those)

TIPS
----
• Print "Paid" + "In Production" to get orders ready for fulfillment
• Use Collection filter when fulfilling a specific team/event order
• Order number on each label helps you match labels to orders
• Do a test print on plain paper first to verify alignment

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Labels don't align with stickers?
→ Check printer margins (set to minimum/default)
→ Verify paper size is Letter (8.5" × 11")
→ Try "Fit to page" OFF—use 100% scale

No orders showing?
→ Ensure at least one status checkbox is selected
→ Click "Apply Filters" after changing options
→ Check that you have orders in those statuses
