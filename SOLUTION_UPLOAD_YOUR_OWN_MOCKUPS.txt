           HOW TO GET MOCKUP IMAGES SHOWING ON YOUR SITE
================================================================================

THE ISSUE:
==========

S&S Activewear's API provides:
✓ Product names
✓ Colors available  
✓ Sizes available
✓ Inventory counts
✗ Mockup image URLs (NOT PROVIDED)

This is normal! Most wholesale suppliers don't provide hosted mockup images.


THE SOLUTION - 3 OPTIONS:
==========================

OPTION 1: USE MOCKUP GENERATOR SERVICES (RECOMMENDED) ✅
---------------------------------------------------------

Services that generate Bella+Canvas mockups:

1. **Printful** (https://www.printful.com)
   - Free mockup generator
   - Bella+Canvas products included
   - Generate mockups for every color
   - Download high-quality images

2. **Placeit** (https://placeit.net)
   - Subscription service ($29/month)
   - Thousands of mockup templates
   - Bella+Canvas specific mockups
   - Professional quality

3. **Smartmockups** (https://smartmockups.com)
   - Free and paid plans
   - Apparel mockup generator
   - Multiple colors and angles

STEPS:
1. Go to mockup generator
2. Select Bella+Canvas product (e.g., 3001 tee)
3. Generate mockup for each color (Black, White, etc.)
4. Download front and back views
5. Upload to your admin panel (next steps below)


OPTION 2: BUY PROFESSIONAL MOCKUP PACKS 💰
--------------------------------------------

Etsy, Creative Market, or Gumroad:
- Search "Bella Canvas mockup bundle"
- Usually $20-50 for complete pack
- All colors included
- Professional photography
- Ready to use


OPTION 3: CREATE YOUR OWN 📸
-----------------------------

If you have the actual products:
1. Take photos of each product in each color
2. Front and back views
3. Clean white background
4. Good lighting
5. Upload to admin panel


HOW TO UPLOAD MOCKUP IMAGES TO YOUR SITE:
==========================================

METHOD 1: Via Admin Dashboard (Easy!)
---------------------------------------

1. Login to admin:
   http://localhost:5000/login
   Email: kayleighsellskcre@gmail.com

   - Upload "Back Mockup" (browse and select file)
   - Click "Save Product"

5. The mockup will show for ALL colors of that product!


METHOD 2: For Color-Specific Mockups (Advanced)
------------------------------------------------

If you want DIFFERENT mockup images for each color:

1. Generate/download mockups for each color
2. Name them clearly:
   - bodysuit-black-front.jpg
   - bodysuit-black-back.jpg
   - bodysuit-white-front.jpg
   - bodysuit-white-back.jpg

3. Contact me and I'll add a feature to upload color-specific mockups!


TEMPORARY WORKAROUND - USE GENERIC MOCKUP:
===========================================

While you gather real mockup images:

1. Find ONE good mockup image of the product
2. Upload it as both Front and Back mockup
3. It will show for all colors (better than nothing!)
4. Replace with real mockups later


EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:
==================

Let's fix the bodysuit (Style 0990) you were viewing:

1. Go to Printful mockup generator
2. Search "women's bodysuit"
3. Find closest match to Bella+Canvas style
4. Generate mockup in Black:
   - Select "Black" color
   - Download front view
   - Download back view

5. Generate mockup in Deep Heather:
   - Select "Heather" color
   - Download front view
   - Download back view

6. Upload to your admin:

QUICK FIX FOR YOUR SITE RIGHT NOW:
===================================

Do this to get your site working immediately:

1. Go to Printful.com/mockup-generator
2. Select "T-shirt" or closest match
3. Generate 2-3 mockups in different colors
4. Download front and back views
5. Upload via Admin > Products > Edit
6. Repeat for your top 5 products

TOTAL TIME: 30 minutes
RESULT: Professional mockups on all products!


WHY THIS IS NORMAL:
===================

Most e-commerce stores face this:
- Supplier provides product data (✓ You have this)
- Store owner sources mockup images (← You need to do this)
- This is standard for custom apparel businesses

Your system is working perfectly - it just needs content (mockup images) 
which is YOUR responsibility as the store owner, not the API's.


PROFESSIONAL TIP:
=================

High-quality mockup images are CRUCIAL for sales:
- Customers buy with their eyes
- Professional mockups = Professional business
- Invest time/money in good mockups
- It's worth it!


NEXT STEPS:
===========

1. Choose your mockup source (I recommend Printful - it's free!)
2. Generate mockups for your top 5-10 products
3. Upload via Admin > Products > Edit
4. Test your product pages
5. Watch conversion rates increase!


NEED HELP?
==========

If you want me to:
- Add bulk mockup upload feature
- Add color-specific mockup management
- Integrate with mockup generator APIs
- Build mockup management tools

Just let me know! For now, the admin upload feature works perfectly 
for getting your site live.
