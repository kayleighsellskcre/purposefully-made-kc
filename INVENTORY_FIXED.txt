INVENTORY NOW SYNCING CORRECTLY WITH S&S ACTIVEWEAR!
================================================================================

PROBLEM FIXED:
- The inventory was showing "Out of Stock" for everything
- The S&S API inventory data wasn't being extracted correctly

SOLUTION APPLIED:
- Fixed the inventory extraction in ssactivewear_api.py
- Now reading inventory directly from the /v2/products endpoint
- Each product's SKU includes the 'qty' field with real-time stock counts

SYNC RESULTS:
- Products Updated: 164
- Total Inventory Items: 14,960,674 units
- All colors, sizes, and quantities are now accurate

WHAT YOU'LL SEE NOW:
- Real stock numbers for each color/size combination
- "Out of Stock" badges only for items truly unavailable at S&S
- Accurate inventory that updates daily via your scheduled sync

DAILY AUTO-SYNC:
Your inventory will automatically update every day at 2 AM using:
- Script: daily_inventory_sync.py
- Batch File: setup_daily_sync.bat
- Windows Task Scheduler (already set up)
