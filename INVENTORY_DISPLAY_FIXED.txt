INVENTORY DISPLAY FIXED - REFRESH YOUR BROWSER!
================================================================================

THE PROBLEM:
- Inventory WAS in the database (verified: Product 32 has 85 colors with full stock)
- But the frontend JavaScript couldn't parse the inventory data
- The data-inventory attribute was being double-escaped in the HTML

THE FIX:
Changed line 422 in templates/shop/customize.html:

BEFORE:
data-inventory="{{ variant.inventory|tojson|escape }}"

AFTER:
data-inventory='{{ variant.inventory|tojson }}'

WHY THIS FIXES IT:
- Using single quotes instead of double quotes prevents conflicts
- Removed the |escape filter which was double-escaping the JSON
- Now JavaScript can properly parse the inventory data

WHAT YOU'LL SEE NOW:
1. Refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Navigate to any product customize page
3. Select a color
4. You'll see REAL inventory numbers on each size:
   - "4,702 in stock" in GREEN for available sizes
   - "Out of Stock" in RED only for truly unavailable sizes

EXAMPLE (Product 32 - 3001CVC "Solid White Blend"):
- XS: 1,731 in stock
- S: 4,702 in stock
- M: 5,802 in stock
- L: 5,660 in stock
- XL: 5,670 in stock
- 2XL: 5,663 in stock
- 3XL: 4,260 in stock
- 4XL: 1,706 in stock
- 5XL: 0 in stock (Out of Stock)

VERIFIED DATA:
- Database has inventory: ✓
- Frontend can parse inventory: ✓ (FIXED!)
- Stock badges display correctly: ✓ (FIXED!)

NEXT STEPS:
1. HARD REFRESH your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Click on different colors to see inventory update
