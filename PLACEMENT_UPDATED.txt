PROFESSIONAL PLACEMENT SYSTEM - UPDATED!
================================================================================

✅ WHAT WAS CHANGED
================================================================================

1. ✅ PROPORTIONAL SIZING
   - Center Chest: Reduced from 35% to 28% (more professional logo size)
   - Left/Right Chest: Reduced from 15% to 12% (proper pocket logo size)
   - Full Back: Reduced from 60% to 55% (better proportions)

2. ✅ REMOVED "FULL FRONT" OPTION
   - Simplified choices to the most common placements
   - Cleaner, more focused UI

3. ✅ ADDED "RIGHT CHEST" OPTION
   - Now have both left and right chest options
   - Perfect for logos that need specific positioning

4. ✅ MIRROR POSITIONING (WEARER'S PERSPECTIVE)
   - "Left Chest" = Shows on RIGHT side of mockup
     (Because that's YOUR left when you wear it)
   
   - "Right Chest" = Shows on LEFT side of mockup
     (Because that's YOUR right when you wear it)
   
   This matches how customers think about their shirts!

5. ✅ ENHANCED PROFESSIONAL STYLING
   - Larger, clearer placement buttons
   - Descriptive subtitles for each option
   - Gold checkmark when selected
   - Smooth hover effects
   - Better visual hierarchy

VISUAL IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================

PLACEMENT BUTTONS NOW SHOW:
✓ Larger, more clickable areas
✓ Bold titles with descriptive subtitles
✓ Smooth hover animations
✓ Gold accent when selected
✓ Checkmark indicator
✓ Professional shadows and borders

EXAMPLE BUTTON LAYOUT:
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   **Center Chest**      │✓ (when selected)
│   Medium size, centered │
└─────────────────────────┘

================================================================================
HOW IT LOOKS FOR CUSTOMERS
================================================================================

When viewing the mockup (looking at someone wearing it):

FRONT VIEW MOCKUP:
        ┌───────────┐
        │   HEAD    │
        └───────────┘
    ┌─────────────────┐
    │  [R]      [L]   │  <- Left/Right chest logos
    │                 │
    │    [CENTER]     │  <- Center chest logo
    │                 │
    └─────────────────┘

Legend:
[L] = "Left Chest" option (on right side of mockup)
[R] = "Right Chest" option (on left side of mockup)

This matches how the customer thinks:
"I want my logo on my left chest" → Shows on right side of mockup

================================================================================
