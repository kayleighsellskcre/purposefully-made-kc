              HOW TO GET FULL COLOR MOCKUPS & INVENTORY SHOWING
================================================================================

CURRENT STATUS:
==============================================================================
✓ Colors showing with names (Asphalt, Athletic Heather, Black, etc.)
✓ Template updated to display color variant images
✓ Routes updated to fetch color data
✗ NO color mockup images yet (just labels)
✗ NO product preview image
✗ NO inventory counts


WHY:
==============================================================================
The product you're viewing was created BEFORE we added the color variant
system. It has:
  ✓ Color names: ["Black", "White", "Navy", etc.]
  ✗ Color mockup images: None
  ✗ Inventory data: None


THE FIX - SYNC FROM S&S ACTIVEWEAR:
==============================================================================

STEP 1: Go to Admin Products
  URL: http://localhost:5000/admin/products

STEP 2: Click "Sync from S&S Activewear" button

STEP 3: Enter number of products
  Enter: 5
  (This will sync 5 Bella+Canvas products)

STEP 4: Click "Start Sync"

STEP 5: Wait 1-2 minutes
  The system is:
  - Fetching product info from S&S
  - Getting ALL color variations
  - Downloading mockup images for EACH color
  - Getting inventory counts for each size in each color
  - Saving everything to database

STEP 6: Check the Products page
  You'll see products listed with data

STEP 7: Go back to SHOP
  http://localhost:5000/shop

STEP 8: Click on a newly synced product

STEP 9: See the magic!
  - Each color box will show actual product mockup
  - Main preview will show product image
  - Sizes will show inventory counts like "M (120 in stock)"


WHAT YOU'LL SEE AFTER SYNC:
==============================================================================

BEFORE (now):
  [Black]  [White]  [Navy]  ← Just labels
  
AFTER (synced):
  [🖼️ Black Shirt]  [🖼️ White Shirt]  [🖼️ Navy Shirt]

  Sizes will show:
  S (45 in stock)

  - Gets inventory for each size

WHAT IF SYNC FAILS:
==============================================================================

If you see "No products returned from S&S API":

1. Check .env file has:
   SSACTIVEWEAR_API_KEY=b691d328-eabf-421a-96e4-84c9a324e20c
   SSACTIVEWEAR_ACCOUNT_NUMBER=948003

2. Restart server (close terminal, run python app.py again)

3. Try syncing just 3 products first

4. Check terminal for error messages


AFTER YOU SYNC:
==============================================================================

✓ All synced products will have full color mockups
✓ Inventory will be live and accurate
✓ Customers can see exactly what they're ordering
✓ Upload artwork and preview on real product colors
✓ Professional, luxury shopping experience!
