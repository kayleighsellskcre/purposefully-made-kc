================================================================================
                   COLOR MOCKUP DISPLAY IS NOW UPDATED!
================================================================================

WHAT WAS CHANGED:
==============================================================================

1. SHOP ROUTES UPDATED
   - Now fetches ProductColorVariant data for each product
   - Passes color variant data (images + inventory) to templates
   - Works for both product detail and customize pages

2. CUSTOMIZE TEMPLATE UPDATED
   - Color swatches now show ACTUAL MOCKUP IMAGES
   - Each color box displays a mini version of the real product image
   - Color name appears at bottom of each swatch
   - Fallback to basic colors if no variants synced yet

3. DATA STRUCTURE
   Each color variant now includes:
   - color_name: "Black", "White", "Navy", etc.
   - front_image: S&S CDN URL for front mockup
   - back_image: S&S CDN URL for back mockup
   - inventory: {"S": 45, "M": 120, "L": 89, ...}


NEXT STEP - SYNC PRODUCTS:
==============================================================================

The templates are ready, but you need to SYNC PRODUCTS to get color data!

1. Go to: http://localhost:5000/admin/products

2. Click: "Sync from S&S Activewear"

3. Enter: 3 (to sync 3 products)

4. Click: "Start Sync"

5. Wait 30-60 seconds

6. Then go to shop and view products - colors will show mockup images!


WHAT YOU'LL SEE AFTER SYNC:
==============================================================================

BEFORE SYNC (what you're seeing now):
  - Empty white boxes for colors
  - Basic color names
  - No product images

AFTER SYNC (what you'll see):
  - Each color box shows actual product mockup
  - "Black" box shows black shirt image
  - "White" box shows white shirt image
  - Hover shows color name
  - Sizes show inventory counts


WHY IT'S NOT SHOWING NOW:
==============================================================================

The product you're viewing (product ID 4) exists in your database
from BEFORE we added the color variant system.

It has:
  ✓ Basic product info
  ✓ Size list
  ✓ Color names list
  ✗ NO color variant data (images + inventory)

To fix: SYNC products from S&S Activewear API!


TECHNICAL DETAILS:
==============================================================================

Old System (before):
  - Product.available_colors = ["Black", "White", "Navy"]
  - Template tries to use color name as CSS color
  - Doesn't work for "Athletic Heather", "Heather Gray", etc.

New System (now):
  - ProductColorVariant table has one row per product+color
  - Each row has front_image_url, back_image_url, size_inventory
  - Template displays actual product mockup images
  - Works for ALL colors with real visual reference


RESTART REQUIRED:
==============================================================================

The server needs to reload to pick up the route changes.

Restarting server now...
