CONFIGURING EMAIL FOR ORDER CONFIRMATIONS
===========================================

Your order confirmation page now accurately reflects whether an email was sent.
Previously it said "We've sent a confirmation email" but no email was actually sent.
Now it only says that when an email is actually delivered.

TO RECEIVE CONFIRMATION EMAILS:
-------------------------------

1. Open your .env file
2. Add or update these lines with REAL values (not placeholders):

   MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
   MAIL_PORT=587
   MAIL_USE_TLS=True
   MAIL_USERNAME=your-actual-email@gmail.com
   MAIL_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
   MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=your-actual-email@gmail.com

3. For Gmail, you MUST use an "App Password" (not your regular password):
   - Go to Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification (enable it)
   - Then: Google Account → Security → App passwords
   - Generate a new app password for "Mail"
   - Use that 16-character password as MAIL_PASSWORD

4. Restart your Flask server after changing .env

WHAT HAPPENS NOW:
-----------------
- When email IS configured: Customers receive a confirmation email with order
  details (items, totals, shipping address). The confirmation page says
  "We've sent a confirmation email to [their email]."

- When email is NOT configured: The confirmation page says "Save this page for
  your records" and explains how to configure SMTP. No false promise.

The confirmation email includes:
- Order number and date
- Full list of items (product, size, color, quantity, price)
- Subtotal, shipping, total
- Shipping address (or "Local Pickup")
